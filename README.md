# FACTum Studio
[//]: # (Architectural Design Constraints Specification and Verification)

FACTum Studio is a tool that supports Architectural Design Patterns (ADPs) specification and verification with the support of interactive verification in Isabelle/HOL.

At this stage of development, the tool has the following key features mainly for specification of ADPs:
* Specification of abstract data types
* Graphical modeling of component types
* Specification of architectural constraints and 
* Specification of architectural guarantees.

The tool is developed using the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and supporting languages xtext and xtend. 

You may download and try a working demo of the FACTum Studio.
